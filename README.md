# SDK Pathfinder with ReactJS

## Local Environment Setup

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` to install the required packages.

Once that's done, run `yarn start` and go to `localhost:3000` (it'll probably open automatically). The website should be running.

## Deploying to GH Pages

When you want to update the website, run `npm run deploy`. This should deploy the site (link above) with the most recent changes from your local repo.
